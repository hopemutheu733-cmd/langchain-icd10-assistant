# ICD-10 Assistant

AI-powered ICD-10 coding support for clinicians, coders, and healthcare teams who need faster, more structured diagnosis suggestions from plain-language descriptions.

> Hosted on a free plan, so the first load after a quiet period can take up to a minute while the server wakes up.

This project turns everyday symptom descriptions into likely ICD-10 diagnosis suggestions using a grounded AI pipeline. Instead of letting the model guess freely, it searches a real ICD-10 database first and only returns codes supported by the data.

## Who this is for

This project is designed for:

- medical coders
- healthcare professionals reviewing diagnosis codes
- AI builders exploring grounded clinical LLM workflows
- teams building healthcare software with real-world data constraints

## Problem it solves

Medical coding is slow, repetitive, and depends on highly specific terminology. People often describe symptoms in plain language, but ICD-10 coding requires precise, standardized terms.

This project reduces that friction by:

- converting natural language into clinical terms
- searching a real diagnosis dataset
- narrowing suggestions to valid ICD-10 codes
- explaining the recommendation in a clear, human-readable format

## What this project does

Given a description like:

```json
{
  "description": "burning pain when passing urine"
}
```

the app returns likely diagnosis suggestions such as:

```json
{
  "clinical_terms": "Dysuria",
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "code": "R30.0",
      "description": "Dysuria",
      "reason": "Burning pain when passing urine matches dysuria."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Why this matters

Medical AI needs to be grounded. A model that simply invents codes is unsafe and unreliable.

This project demonstrates a more practical pattern:

- interpret the user input
- retrieve real data from a trusted code table
- let the model choose from valid candidates
- return a response with reasoning

## How it works

1. The user enters a plain-English medical description.
2. An LLM rewrites the description into more clinical terminology.
3. The system searches a MySQL ICD-10 dataset for matching candidates.
4. The model selects the strongest matches from the real data.
5. The final answer is returned with short explanations.

## Tech stack

- Python
- FastAPI
- LangChain
- OpenRouter
- MySQL
- HTML / frontend
- Docker
- Render

## Key features

- plain-English symptom-to-code workflow
- grounded results from a real ICD-10 dataset
- candidate filtering before final output
- REST API + UI
- evaluation script for example cases
- deployment-ready container setup

## Evaluation

I tested the app on 20 common symptom descriptions and tracked whether an acceptable code appeared in the suggestions.

| Measure | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Acceptable code appeared in the suggestions | 16 of 20 (80%) |
| First suggestion was acceptable | 16 of 20 |

Known limitations:

- keyword-based search can still miss unusual phrasing
- the project is not a certified billing tool
- it covers diagnosis coding, not full coding workflows

## Safety and limitations

- This is a portfolio project, not a final clinical coding tool.
- Suggestions should be reviewed by a qualified coder.
- Do not enter real patient data into the demo.
- The project covers ICD-10 diagnosis codes only.
